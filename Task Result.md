## Used technologies / Frameworks

I use the following technologies / frameworks in my project:

- Javascript / Angular

I chose Angular because:
    -  Angular has a detailed documentation
    -  Angular has a component-based architecture; Components can easily be replaced and decoupled as well as reused in other parts of an app;
    - Angular has a great ecosystem of third-party components

## Used 3rd Party Libraries

I use the following 3rd party libraries in my project: 

Name | Reason
--- | ---
[PapaParse](https://alberthaff.dk/projects/ngx-papaparse/docs/v3) |Parser library for CSV files.
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) | Simple RWD framework for designing the front end.
[ngx-toaster](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-toastr) | For showing notifications and alerts
